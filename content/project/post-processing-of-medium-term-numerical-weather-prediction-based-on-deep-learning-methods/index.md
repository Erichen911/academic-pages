Description: NWP is a three-dimensional weather forecast tensor with temporal and spatial information in European space. My research is to use a 3D fully convolutional network to improve forecast accuracy.
Improve the Focal loss method to solve the sample imbalance of precipitation data.
Connect a discriminator network after fully convolutional network to improve wind direction similarity.
Construct a U-net structure network to improve the accuracy of the forecast.
Connect a constructive learning method to improve the accuracy of visibility and total cloud cover.
